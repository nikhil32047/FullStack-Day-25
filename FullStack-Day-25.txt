Day 25:
==========

1) What is a Class?
==========================
A class is a blueprint or template used to create objects.
It defines data (variables/attributes) and behavior (methods/functions) together.
Classes support Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

Example:

class Student:
    name = "Nikhil"
    age = 22

Here, Student is a class and name, age are class attributes.


2) What is an Object & a Method?
=======================================
An object is an instance of a class.
A method is a function defined inside a class that describes the behavior of an object.


Example:

class Student:
    def display(self):
        print("Hello Student")

s1 = Student()   # object creation
s1.display()    # method call

self refers to the current object.


3) Constructor (__init__)
================================
A constructor is a special method that runs automatically when an object is created.
It is used to initialize object data.


Example:

class Student:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

s1 = Student("Nikhil", 22)
print(s1.name, s1.age)
